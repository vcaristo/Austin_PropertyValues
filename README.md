This was a group project in Big Data Analytics at Penn that I've continued to add to. 

The Colab notebook in this project includes full code and details on the assessment of geospatial machine learning models to predict 
property values in Austin, TX. This includes: 
  - Data Wrangling and Geospatial Feature Engineering
  - Exploratory Data Analysis and PCA
  - Prediction model development and optimization (neural network, linear regression, decision trees)

Here is an interactive web-map that shows the how tree cover is related to median single-family home prices in Austin: https://vcaristo.github.io/Austin_PropertyValues/side_by_side_maps.html
