This was a group project in Big Data Analytics at Penn that I've continued to add to. 

The <a href="Predicting_Property_Values_AustinTX.ipynb">Jupyter notebook</a> in this project includes full code and details on the assessment of geospatial machine learning models to predict 
property values in Austin, TX. This includes: 
  - Data Wrangling and Geospatial Feature Engineering
  - Exploratory Data Analysis and PCA
  - Prediction model development and optimization (neural network, linear regression, decision trees)

Here is an <a href="https://vcaristo.github.io/Austin_PropertyValues/side_by_side_maps.html">interactive web-map</a> that shows the how tree cover is related to median single-family home prices in Austin:
